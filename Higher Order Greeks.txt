Higher Order Greeks

Vega - A measurement of Option's sensitivity to Implied Volatilies

1. Higher Order Greeks that affects Vega (To manage Vega):
- Vomma - How Vega will change relative to changes in Implied Volatility ; the change of vega as the volatility changes
- Vanna - How Vega will change relative to price moves; the change of vega as the spot changes
- Veta - How Vega changes every second

2. Higher Order Greeks that affects Delta (To manage Delta):
- Charm
- Gamma
- Speed

3. Higher Order Greeks that affects Price (To manage Price):
- Lambda

4. Delta-Vega Hedging reduces risk by 50 %

5. Managing Delta alone increases risk by 200 % (based on Cho and Koh)

Short Dated FX:
- Have a higher volatility risk than interest rate risk

Why we want Black Scholes Model for pricing:
- We want to be conforming our pricing model to Black Scholes because the only source of risk is the underlying exchange rate.
- The fundamentals of risk-neutral valuation is to use a replicating portfolio of assets with known prices to remove any risk.
- Black-Scholes model is used here because it is preference free, since options can be replicated, the theoretical values do not depend on investors risk preferences.
- Black Scholes model of option pricing still remains the only consistent one for pricing and hedging options.

The cost of hedging
- For the Black-Scholes valuation for Europen Options, closed formulae cann be easily implemented and results in pricing by plugging parameters into the pricer
- However, the real question is that which parameters should be used to get a correct price ?
 - What does a correct price means?
 - This Black Scholes formula is derived so that the prices it generates for an option reflects the cost of hedging the option
 - If the underlying and risk-free bonds are dynamically traded, the payoff of the option can be replicated.
 - The cost of performing hedging must equal to the price of the option

During the selling of an option,
- A trader charges a premium for the risks he is bearing
- Even in the case of Vanilla Options, the price depends on many parameters
- Some are linked to market; this is the case of interest rates
- Other risks such as the spot price, dividends or borrowing costs are directly related to the underlying assest itself.

Financial Products
- Financial products are unlike many other commercial products, financial instruments are produced after they are sold.
- These products are not necessarily hedged to replication as this is typically not possible, but they are hedged to risk exposures that are tolerable
- There are many risks to be understood, managed and priced into the ask and bid prices of structured products
- Therefore, exact replication is not possible, but a residual of an acceptable risk is possible


Exercise
1. Consider a stock Alpha that can take two specific values 70 and 120 after 5 years.

2. Alpha’s initial spot is equal to 100.

3. The equity analysts covering this stock and working for a major
financial institution state that there is a 60% probability that the final spot price will be 120 and a 40% probability that the final spot ends at 70.

4. Then, what would be the fair price of a 5-year European at-the-money call option on Alpha? To keep things simple, let’s assume
that interest rates and dividends are both zero.

Answer:
Probability are useless in our pricing

Assumptions of Black Scholes Model:
- The vol of the underlying asset is constant over time
- The underlying asset can be traded continuosly, and its price S, is log-normally distributed [this means that the log-returns of S are normally distributed]
- One can always short sell the underlying stock
- One does not incur transaction costs or taxes
- All securities are perfectly divisible, meaning that it is possible to buy any fraction of a share
- One can always borrrow and lend cash at known risk-free interest rate, r, which is assumed to be constant
- The stock pays a constant dividend yield, q
